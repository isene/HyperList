  Multi-line Items (HyperList spec)
    + This is a multi-line item that continues
     on the next line with a space prefix
    + Items with the plus sign can span multiple lines
     making it easy to write longer descriptions
     without creating separate items
    Consistency Rule Example
      1 When one item at a level has a starter (identifier)
       all items at that level need starters
      2 This second item also needs an identifier
      + Or you can use a plus sign as starter
    Nested Multi-line Items  
      + Parent item that spans multiple lines
       with detailed information on the first level
        + Child item also spanning multiple lines
         providing more specific details
        Regular child item after multi-line
    Real-world Examples
      + Meeting notes from project kickoff: Discussed timeline,
       budget constraints, resource allocation, and identified
       key stakeholders who need to be involved
      + Action item: Research competitive solutions in the market,
       compile findings into a report, and present recommendations
       to the management team by end of month
