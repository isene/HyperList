		AND: This is a very long line with operator keywords that should wrap in split view mode. OR: Continue with more text. IF: Even more content. THEN: Final part
		Short line
		Another AND: long line with lots of text that will definitely wrap when the pane is narrow in split view mode, especially with OR: more operators
	Properties and dates
		Purpose: Test wrapping with property coloring and long descriptions that span multiple visual lines when displayed in narrow panes
		Date: 2025-08-13 14:30: This is a timestamp property with a long description following it that should wrap
	Mixed content
		"Quoted text that is very long and should wrap properly" with AND: operators and #hashtags all mixed together
		References like <test_reference_with_long_name> should wrap correctly
		[X] Checkbox with long description that continues for quite a while to test wrapping
	Test in both panes
		Use :vs to enable split view
		Check that colors display correctly on wrapped lines
		No ANSI codes should appear as literal text
		Both panes should handle wrapping properly
